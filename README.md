# Design-an-automated-report-generation-model-for-medical-images
We aim to design an automated report generation model for medical images leveraging an encoderâ€“ decoder architecture. For this task, we will use the Open-I collection of the Indiana University Chest X-ray dataset from the  Indiana University Hospital network. This dataset consists of 7,470 X-ray images and 3851 patients  reports.
